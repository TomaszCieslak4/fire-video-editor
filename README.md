## What is Fire?
Our video editor provides users with an easy tool to manage and edit their videos online without downloading a large application. This type of editor is not the first of its kind but will be a unique product that will stand out from the handful of competitors. Identifying the competition is crucial for our success since it allows our product to be distinguishable by introducing features that the competition lacks.

The online video editor Clipchamp, developed in 2012 is fully functional and is a direct competitor to our developing product. Our editing platform is different by providing custom animations through the use of keyframes. If a beginner editor is looking to flair up the animation side of their edit, our product will allow an image to have a beginning state or condition that can change over time to an end state (i.e. an animation), rather than our competitorâ€™s limited static image placement. 

The competition did not focus on the keyframe aspect of the editor most likely because they expect their user-base to not be experienced enough to use that specific feature. Allowing keyframing involves setting attributes of position and time and interpolating between them to insert images onto a video. This feature allows for the possibility for animation and transition.
